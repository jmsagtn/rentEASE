        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          PetCare is an online appointment system for home-based pet check-ups. Clients can sign up or log in to book pet services, choose a date and time, and confirm their appointment — all in a few easy steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin, users must create an account or sign in. Once logged in, navigate to the “Book” tab to start scheduling a home service. You’ll be prompted to select a service (e.g., Vaccination, Grooming), input your pet’s details (type, size, breed), and choose a date and time based on availability. An invoice will be generated before final confirmation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Admins will review the submitted request and approve or decline it. Users can check the status of their appointments on the “Transactions” tab.
        </p>

        <h2>User Roles & Permissions</h2>
        <p>There are two main roles in the system: Admin and Client. Each has specific permissions to ensure smooth service management.</p>
        <table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Role</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Permissions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Admin</strong></td>
      <td>System administrator</td>
      <td>Can view and manage all bookings, set available time slots, and approve/decline appointments</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Client</strong></td>
      <td>Pet owner or customer</td>
      <td>Can book appointments, view transaction history, and manage account details</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


        <h2>Notifications</h2>
        <p>
          The system notifies users via email when their appointment is approved, declined, or updated. Admins receive alerts when a new booking is submitted. More notification options (SMS, calendar sync) may be added in future updates.
        </p>

        <h2>Account Settings</h2>
        <p>
          Clients can manage their profile, update contact information, and change their passwords under the “Account” tab. Admins can also configure service settings and available schedules through their dashboard.
        </p>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Q: Can I cancel or reschedule my appointment?</strong><br>
          A: Currently, clients must contact the admin directly for cancellations or changes. This feature is planned for future versions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Q: What services are offered?</strong><br>
          A: Services include vaccinations, deworming, check-ups, and grooming. Available services are listed during booking.
        </p>
